# Oculy

**Machine Learning for Eye Tracking with EOG Sensors**

Blink and you’ll miss it—your eyes are in control.

Blending neuroscience, biosignals, and ML to make your eyes the ultimate interface!

Oculy is a project that processes raw electrooculography (EOG) signals and converts them into machine learning applications for eye tracking and movement analysis. The system captures EOG data using BITalino sensors and applies signal processing techniques to extract meaningful patterns for ML model training.

Our Goal: Build an interactive prototype where users can control digital interfaces (games, cursors, or menus) using only eye movements and blinks detected from biosignals. Examples: hands-free gaming, accessibility-focused communication systems, or artistic “eye-drawn” visualizations.

## Features

- Raw EOG signal acquisition and processing
- Signal filtering and noise reduction
- Eye movement pattern detection
- Blink detection algorithms
- Synthetic EOG data generation for testing
- Machine learning pipeline for eye tracking applications

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd oculy
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
